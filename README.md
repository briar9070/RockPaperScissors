# RockPaperScissors
rps plays a single round of rock paper scissors and alerts the user if they win, lose, or draw.
rpsGame prompts the player to choose how many rounds they would like to play and loops through the game that many times. it keeps score and notifies the player if they have won, lost, or tied the game. A running score is kept in the console and udpated following each round.

rps and rpsGame Lessons Learned
- Learned to uitlise Math.random() to generate a random choice.
- Practiced creating a function to later be called in the code. Could have been implemented better.
- Learned to prompt the user for an input and stored it in a string.
- First time implementing a toUpperCase() to create a generic variable not dependent on the case the user enters the string.
- Practiced creating a if, else if, else statement.
- First time creating a while loop.
- Psuedo code before starting coding is a massive time/fristration saver.
- Learned that variables amended within a while loop are not limited to the loop. They can be called following the loop completion and will have the amended values

Improvements
- Could create an if loop on the user prompt so the prompt is repeated if they enter an invalid repsonse.
- Code could be simplified by using or || statements in the rock paper scissors comparison. This would limit the feedback to the user about what choice both players made however
